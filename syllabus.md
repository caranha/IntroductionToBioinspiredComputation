# Syllabus

## 1. Course Title
A Broad Tour of Bio-inspired Computation

## 2. Key words
Artificial Life, Evolutionary Computation, Computational Intelligence,
Multi Agent Systems, Simulation, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence

## 3. Purpose
This course aims to give students from a non-CS background a broad understanding of Bio-inspired Computation and its related fields. Bio-inspired computation is a research approach that creates computational systems that are replicas of natural systems. One well-known example is Artificial Neural-Networks (ANNs), a technology that, inspired by the workings of the human brain, has launched a revolution in the field of artificial intelligence in the last decade.

In this course, the student will learned about several such technologies, including their basic concepts, their applications, and future directions. The course is conducted in a hands-on manner, and the students are invited to think about how these technologies can mix with their own specialties.

## 4. Brief description
In the past decade, technologies based on "Artificial Intelligence" have grow to affect many aspects of our daily lives. Today it is important, even for people who are not experts in computer science, to have a working knowledge of the principles, possibilities, and issues related to these techniques.

In this course, we give a broad overview of the research areas related to Artificial Intelligence. We focus not only on Machine Learning and Deep Learning, but instead look at the broader area of "Bioinspired Computation" -- the development of information systems that are inspired by, or try to imitate, natural systems.

On each lecture, we will focus on one of four research areas: Artificial Life, Multi Agent Systems, Evolutionary Computation, and Machine Learning. In each lecture, we will learn the basic concepts of that area, survey recent advances, and acquire practical knowledge through hands-on examples. We expect students to obtain the necessary knowledge to be able interact with these research areas using a critical eye.

In the final lecture, the students are expected to prepare a report that outlines an interdisciplinary research proposal between their own research field and some of the topics studied in this lecture.

## 5. Course plan
Each lecture is 3 periods of 75 minutes. The last period is used by the students to explore the computer systems introduced in the lecture, and have group discussions with the teacher. Each module is independent from the others.

### Topic 05: Final Project and presentation
- Explanation of the final project
- Group discussion and preparation
- Final presentation and discussion

## Bibliography
As this lecture is a "wide tour", we will not follow one specific textbook. However, each of the topics has suggestions of books, papers and other readings for students who want to learn more. See [the readings list](readings.md).

## Methods of evaluation

The students are invited to prepare an interdisciplinary research project proposal, which mixes their own study fields and some of the techniques described in this lecture. The lecturer will provide feedback and advice on the preparation of the research proposal.

At the end of the last class, each student or student group will make a short presentation of their project idea, and a discussion session between the students and the lecturer will provide feedback on the projects. Based on this feedback, the students will write a report with the full project proposal.

The final grade will be based on the presentation (20%) and the report (80%).

## Necessary items

During the class, the lecturer will introduce several software applications that implement the research topics introduced in class. By experimenting with these applications, the students will increase their knowledge of the class topics.

Most of the applications will be either in python, or in a web application. The user must bring to class a computer able to run Python programs and with a modern web browser and internet connection.

## Other messages for students

The students are expected to make questions during the class and discuss the course contents from their own experiences and points of view.

The idea of this class is to be an opportunity for discovery of new ideas, more than a technical course. Good luck, and have fun!
