The third lecture introduces Multi-Agent Systems as a method to reproduce
the effects of multiple decisions in parallel.


The third lecture talks about Multi-Agent systems, focusing on research projects
that our group is currently working on.

# Introduction to Multi Agent Systems
- Intro Based on Hasebe's lecture

## Simple Example of Multi Agent Systems
- HOMINIDS paper / Digital Archeology

## Multi Agent Systems and Genetic Algorithms
- MAS + Optimization: PSO
- MAS + TSP: ACO

# MAS Projects
## Tsunami Evacuation (Matsushima)
## Covid Infection (Epidemicon)
## Minecraft Settlement Generation
## AIWolf

# Open Issues in Multi Agent Systems
- Complex vs Simple Models (Digital Archeology)
- Representing Knowledge (AIWOlf)
- Using data from societies (Epidemicon) (validation, learning, ethical issues)

# Hands-on Learning
- GAMA Platform
- Quickly mention that there are other platforms, then show how to use GAMA

# Notes:
## Multi-Agent System Software:
- Gama: https://gama-platform.org/ -- Spatially Explicit
- Netlogo: https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/ -- Very traditional
- MESA: https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ -- Python
- artisoc: https://mas.kke.co.jp/en/artisoc4/ -- Japanese, Mac/Windows only, not opensource
