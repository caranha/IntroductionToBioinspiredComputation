This first lecture introduces the course as a whole, and then focuses on
the concepts of Artificial life.

# Outline:

## Introduction to the Course: (15 Min)
- Goals of the Course,
- Lecturer Introduction,
- Class Format and Schedule

## Bioinspired computation: (15 min)
The overal topic of this course are computational systems that are inspired by,
or try to reproduce, biological systems. More precisely: Alife, EvoComp,
Multi-Agent Systems, and Neural Networks.

Why is Bioinspired computation important?

# Today's topic: Artificial life
## Basic Ideas (60 min)
Reproducing life in an artificial system
  - Example: The game of life
  - Types of artificial life: Soft, Hard, Wet
  - Questions of Artificial Life:
    - Understanding Life (Alife characteristics, Homeostatis, Autopoiesis, etc)
    - Making Life (Alife simulations / Life as it could be)
    - Imagining Life (Alife Art: Spec Bio, Wind robots)
## Artificial Life Systems (60 min)
  - Diffusion Systems
  - Self-replicating systems
    - Cellular Automata
    - Physical self-replicators
    - Artificial Chemistry
  - Artificial Biology
    - Avida
    - Replication of cells, genes and evolution
  - Agency Systems
    - What is agency
    - Simple Agency robots
    - Non-intelligent systems with agency: Oil drops and crystals
    - Agency and humans (Androids, Robots)
  - Alife simulations
    - Bibites, more complex systems trying to replicate life
## Other concepts (30 min)
  - Alife for observing life in exoplanets, earth as an exoplanet
  - Homeostatic Awakening paper

# Hands on systems:
- Game of Life,
- Avida-Edu,
- Bibites,
