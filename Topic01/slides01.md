# The goal of this course

.cols[
.c80[
**Artificial Intelligence** (AI) is an extremely hot topic today. All researchers
want to do it, all companies want to buy it, all governments want to use it!

However, there are so many different views of AI that sometimes it is hard to
actually understand what it is, where it came from, and **what it could be**.
]
.c30[
.right[![:scale 60%](img/irasutoya_robot.png)]
]]

In this course I want to give you a _wide_ view of topics related "Artificial Intelligence", today and in the past, beginning with the fundamental ideas of **Bioinspired Computation** and **Artificial Life** (Alife).

I hope you can learn some fun and inspiring ideas in this course!

]

.c70[
Usually, when we think of computing systems, we think of projects carefully built from mathematics and engineering to solve some human need.

We see these artificial artifacts as extremely useful, and possessing design and abilities unlike anything found in the natural world.

The artificial is clean, organized, and helpful. While the natural is messy and chaotic and a bit of a mistery.

# Being Inspired by Nature

On the other hand, natural creatures sometimes exhibit incredible abilities!

.cols[
.c20[
![:scale 95%](img/nature_ants.png)

.c30[
**Ants:**
- Pheromone communication

.c20[
![:scale 90%](img/nature_spider.png)

.c30[
**Spiders:**
- Nests capture prey
- Spider mind games
- Spider silk strength
- Flexible movement
]
]

.greentext[And many others!] We should draw inspiration from the natural world to build our systems!

**Bioinspired Computation** are disciplines that try to reproduce these abilities in computing systems.

# Bioinspired Examples

.largetext[

Let's look at two examples of bio-inspired systems:


- "*Tabbot*": A robot inspired by spider's movement;


- "*Boids*": A CG system inspired by flocks of birds;
]

---

# Bioinspired System example 01: Tabbot

.cols[
  .c40[

  - **Ingo Rechenberg** was a German scientist who wanted to develop robots capable of navigating extreme terrain conditions, such as deserts.

  ![:scale 80%](img/tabbot_Ingo.png)
  ]
  .c30[

  ![](img/tabbot_spider.gif)

  In the Sahara desert, he found the "somersaulting spider", which used this jumping motion to flee from predators in high speed.

  ]
  .c30[

  - Based on the spider's somersault, he developed a robot that can move quickly on sand.

# Being Inspired by Nature: Example 02 Boids

.c50[
.center[![:scale 90%](img/boids_natural.gif)]
]
.c50[
.center[![:scale 90%](img/boids_animation.gif)]
]
]

.greentext[Boids] is a Computer Graphics system design to look like a flock of birds. The movement of each bird is defined by **three simple rules**.

---

# How do boids move?

.cols[
.c30[
- Inspired by how birds flock together without .redtext[explicit communication], the Boids system also avoids using a central controller for the movement.

- Each boid moves following .greentext[three simple rules], using only the information that it can sense nearby.
]
.c10[]
.c60[
**The three Boids rules:**


![:scale 20%](img/boids_rule1.gif)
Rule 1: **Cohesion**: Move towards the swarm

![:scale 20%](img/boids_rule2.gif)
Rule 2: **Avoidance**: Move away from others

![:scale 20%](img/boids_rule3.gif)
Rule 3: **Alignment**: Align direction
]
]

---

# Boids and Emergence

By adding together **three simple rules**, and **decentralized decision making**, the Boids system achieves **complex, life-life behavior**!

.center[.largetext[
![:scale 20%](img/boids_rule1.gif) + ![:scale 20%](img/boids_rule2.gif) + ![:scale 20%](img/boids_rule3.gif) = ![:scale 20%](img/boids_animation.gif)
]]

When the interaction of simple rules or individuals cause complex behavior in a system, we call it **emergence**.

**Emergence** is an important and desirable characteristics of bioinspired systems!

Should we consider the tamagochi "alive"?
- If yes, what are the implications? "Tamagochi abuse"?
- If not, why not? What are the conditions to life?

Considering these questions is the key to "Alife"!

# Artificial Life Today

.largetext[
Today, Artificial Life is an interdisciplinary field, including biologists, computer scientists, mathematicians, engineers, philosophers and artists.

Research in Artificial Life is usually divided in three large groups:

- **"Soft" Alife**: Research involving simulations and mathematical models;

- **"Hard" Alife**: Research involving robots and physical devices;

- **"Wet" Alife**: Research involving biology and chemistry;
]

---

# Soft Alife


.largetext[
Soft (Software) alife is the subgroup of Artificial Life research that focuses
on **computational** approaches.

Soft Alife research usually involves the definition of mathematical models
of life, and the extensive experimentation of those models using computer
simulations.
]

.right[![:scale 30%](img/GameOfLife_GliderGun.gif)]

---

# Reaction-Diffusion systems

**Reaction-Diffusion Systems** are mathematical models that can be used to represent and reproduce biological phenomena .footmark[a] .

R-D systems are usually composed of a equation to describe the .greentext[Diffusion] of elements, and a different equation to describe the .redtext[Reaction] between these elements.

These equations are calculated in an *iterative* fashion, leading to an evolving landscape that can assume very natural-looking characteristics.

]

---

# Life Simulations

Soft Alife often use **Simulations** to reproduce situations and mechanisms associated with living systems. For example, .greentext[AVIDA] is a simulation that reproduces the process of mutation in single cellular beings.

By changing the parameters of the simulation, we can observe the effect of mutation and resources competition in evolution, and how niches evolve.

We will learn more about AVIDA at the end of the lecture today.

# Soft Alife: Research Concerns

.largetext[
- **Controlled Experimentation on models of life**: Using the simulation context to re-run a simulation with many different parameters and rules.

- **Emergence of complex systems from simple rules**: Defining the simplest models that exhibit interesting behaviors.

- **Simulation of speculative life forms**: Developing what-if scenarios in silico.
]

---

# Hard Alife

.largetext[

Hard (Hardware) Alife research focuses on hardware: Usually robots, but also other devices.

Because it exists in the real world, .greentext[Hard Alife] has to deal with the imprecisions and uncertainties of our world, and also how very different agents (and the environment!) interact with each other.
]

.right[![:scale 30%](img/irasutoya_robot.png)]

---

# Hard Alife: Research Concerns

.largetext[
Hard Alife focuses on the relationship between artificial creatures and
their environment.

Keywords:
- **Robustness**: How can artificial beings exist in a very complex and unforgiving world?
- **Embodiment**: How do artificial beings and the environment influence each other?
- **Agency**: What does it mean for a creature to make choice and to act in the environment?

- The dark grid map is our "digital petri dish"

- It is the environment for the digital creatures

- Each cell in the grid holds one artificial organism

- Space is constrained, so individuals compete for space

- Organisms are composed of simple computer programs.

- Each circle is a computer command.
  - There are 26 different commands.
  - Organisms have a total of 50 commands.

- This set of commands is an Avidian's DNA!
  - a single command is one gene.

# Effects of Mutation in AVIDA

We know that Avidians have 50 genes:
- How many genes are expected to mutate with the default mutation rate of 2%?
- How about if we change the mutation rate to 10%?

Change the mutation rate as you like:
- Try changing it to 100%
- Save the resulting offspring in the freezer
- Run the new offspring. Is it still able to replicate? Why?

# Using the Petri Dish

.largetext[
- When you run the petri dish, the individual will multiply and and mutate.

- Some mutations may cause the individual to replicate faster. Or inversely, to become unable to mutate.

- You can select new individuals in the petri dish to save them or observe them.

# Adding Resources ("nutrients")

.largetext[
- You can simulate selection pressure by adding resources/nutriends to the environment.

![](img/avidab.png)

- Avidians can collect these resources by replicating these programs inside their genome.

- If the Avidian collect a resource, it will replicate faster.

# Hands-on exploring time:

In groups of 2 or 3 people, explore the Alife simulations we saw today. Discuss your findings with each other, ask me questions as you play.

Explore the effects of changing the environment. Evolve Avidians in one environment, save them and transfer them to a different environment.

Make Avidians that evolved in different environments compete.
