The second lecture introduces Evolutionary Computation, from general concepts,
to optimization algorithms, to specific cool projects.

# Outline

## What is Evolutionary Computation
In the last lecture, we talked about two topics:

- Bioinspired Computation: Why do we want to imitate nature in our systems
- Artificial Life: The study of artificial systems that have "life-like" properties.

When we think about life on earth, the mechanism that caused the incredible variety
of life we have in this planet is *evolution*. So when creating systems that
are inspired in nature, including artificial life systems, what we are really
doing is reproducing the work of evolution.

Immediately, we ask ourselves the question: Could we create artificial systems
that are equally able to evolve, and if we do, how far can these systems evolve?

*Evolutionary Computation* is the field of research that try to answer these
questions (... to be continued ...)

## A Recap on Natural Evolution

## Evolutionary Computation Example
- From natural evolution to Artificial Evolution
- Example: Boxcar 2D (video or software)

## Why Evolutionary Computation?
- Evolution is powerful;
- Evolution can surprise us;
- Evolution can give creativity to artificial systems;

# Evolutionary Computation and Optimization
- Outline:
  - Traditional EvoComp application: Optimization
