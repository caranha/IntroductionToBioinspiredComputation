# What is Evolutionary Computation?

- Slide with images from underwater creatures
- Nature has surprised us with a very wide array of creatures

---

# What is Evolutionary Computation?

- What if computers could evolve with the same variety that we see in nature?
- What sorts of different computing systems could we observe?

---

# What is Evolutionary Computation?

- **Evolutionary Computation** is the name we give to a very large variety of technologies

- All these technologies have one thing in common: They are inspired by the natural evolutionary process, and want to reproduce it inside a computer.

---

# Discussion

- What do you think computers could do, if they were able to evolve?
- What about other technologies? What kind of technology would you like to endow with evolution?
