# The goal of this course

.cols[
.c80[
**Artificial Intelligence** (AI) is an extremely hot topic today. All researchers
want to do it, all companies want to buy it, all governments want to use it!

However, there are so many different views of AI that sometimes it is hard to
actually understand what it is, where it came from, and **what it could be**.
]
.c30[
.right[![:scale 60%](img/irasutoya_robot.png)]
]]

In this course I want to give you a _wide_ view of topics related "Artificial Intelligence", today and in the past, beginning with the fundamental ideas of **Bioinspired Computation** and **Artificial Life** (Alife).

I hope you can learn some fun and inspiring ideas in this course!

# Important: Stop me to ask questions!

.largetext[
The four topics of this course are .redtext[huge]. It is
impossible to cover everything in five days.

So I want to focus on the .greentext[interesting parts].

If you want to know more about something,  
or if you want to ask a question, **please ask it right away!**.

It will be more fun if we have an active conversation!
]

# Report and Grading

.largetext[
This course will be graded on a report. (Deadline, October 13th)

In this report, you will write a **research proposal** using the topics
presented in this course, **and your own study field**.

Think interdisciplinarity!

On Friday you will make a short presentation about your idea for
the report. I will give feedback on your idea for your report.

More details Friday!]

]

.c70[
Usually, when we think of computing systems, we think of projects carefully built from mathematics and engineering to solve some human need.

We see these artificial artifacts as extremely useful, and possessing design and abilities unlike anything found in the natural world.

The artificial is clean, organized, and helpful. While the natural is messy and chaotic and a bit of a mistery.

# Being Inspired by Nature

On the other hand, natural creatures sometimes exhibit incredible abilities!

.cols[
.c20[
![:scale 95%](img/nature_ants.png)
]
.c30[
**Ants:**
- Pheromone communication
- Cooperative hunting / building
- Stigmergy
]
.c20[
![:scale 90%](img/nature_spider.png)
]
.c30[
**Spiders:**
- Nests capture prey
- Spider mind games
- Spider silk strength
- Flexible movement
]
]

.greentext[And many others!] We should draw inspiration from the natural world to build our systems!

**Bioinspired Computation** are disciplines that try to reproduce these abilities in computing systems.

# Bioinspired Examples

.largetext[

Let's look at two examples of bio-inspired systems:


- "*Tabbot*": A robot inspired by spider's movement;


- "*Boids*": A CG system inspired by flocks of birds;
]

# Bioinspired System example 01: Tabbot

.cols[
  .c40[

  - **Ingo Rechenberg** was a German scientist who wanted to develop robots capable of navigating extreme terrain conditions, such as deserts.

  ![:scale 80%](img/tabbot_Ingo.png)
  ]
  .c30[

  ![](img/tabbot_spider.gif)

  In the Sahara desert, he found the "somersaulting spider", which used this jumping motion to flee from predators in high speed.

  ]
  .c30[

  - Based on the spider's somersault, he developed a robot that can move quickly on sand.

# Being Inspired by Nature: Example 02 Boids

.c50[
.center[![:scale 90%](img/boids_natural.gif)]
]
.c50[
.center[![:scale 90%](img/boids_animation.gif)]
]
]

.greentext[Boids] is a Computer Graphics system design to look like a flock of birds. The movement of each bird is defined by **three simple rules**.

---

# How do boids move?

.cols[
.c30[
- Inspired by how birds flock together without .redtext[explicit communication], the Boids system also avoids using a central controller for the movement.

- Each boid moves following .greentext[three simple rules], using only the information that it can sense nearby.
]
.c10[]
.c60[
**The three Boids rules:**


![:scale 20%](img/boids_rule1.gif)
Rule 1: **Cohesion**: Move towards the swarm

![:scale 20%](img/boids_rule2.gif)
Rule 2: **Avoidance**: Move away from others

![:scale 20%](img/boids_rule3.gif)
Rule 3: **Alignment**: Align direction
]
]

---

# Boids and Emergence

By adding together **three simple rules**, and **decentralized decision making**, the Boids system achieves **complex, life-life behavior**!

.center[.largetext[
![:scale 20%](img/boids_rule1.gif) + ![:scale 20%](img/boids_rule2.gif) + ![:scale 20%](img/boids_rule3.gif) = ![:scale 20%](img/boids_animation.gif)
]]

When the interaction of simple rules or individuals cause complex behavior in a system, we call it **emergence**.

**Emergence** is an important and desirable characteristics of bioinspired systems!

# Bioinspired computation and this course

- All the technologies we will see in this course are, in one way or another, inspired by natural processes.

  - Evolutionary Computation: Natural Evolution;
  - Multi Agent Systems: Insects Swarms, social animals;
  - Neural Networks: Brain cells;
  - Artificial Life: Well... everything!

---

# How can we represent "Life" in a computer?

Example: Conway's "Game of Life"

# Is the Game of Life really Life?

What is life? That is a very hard question, and answering that question is
one of the research goal of Artificial Life.

The fact that even the simple Game of Life can make us think about this
is very important.

# Hands-on Experimentation with Alife Systems

In this section, I will introduce the following three systems in more detail.
You are invited to explore these systems by yourself, make your own discoveries,
and exchange your impressions with others in the class.

- Game of Life
- Avida
- The Bibites

---

# Game of Life Simulation

- What is?
- How to use?
- Tasks: Create a long pattern, create a stable pattern, try to create a pattern that generates other patterns.

---

# Avida-edu Simulation

- What is?
- How to use?
- Tasks: Evolution competition. Measure the length of genomes in winning populations. Identify why a mutation becomes dominant.

---

# The Bibites Simulation

- What is?
- How to use?
- Tasks: Run at advanced speed, and give a name to interesting mutations. Observe which characteristics are helpful or nocive to the creatures. Observe when new mutations start to dominate the population (may take some time!)

---

# Your task for the rest of the day:

Form pairs or trios, and choose one of the three simulators to explore.

Try to do the tasks suggested, but also explore following your interests and curiosity.

Exchange ideas with your group mates about what you are seeing, and what it could be used for.
