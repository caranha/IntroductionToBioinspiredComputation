# Course Goals

---

# This is a quick tour -- please ask any time to stop and look around!

Artificial Life, Computation Evolution, Multi-agent systems. These are huge
topics, with many interesting questions to answer.

In this course, I will touch in some of those questions that I find to be
both interesting, and also representative.

However, if you want to know more about one topic or another, or ask a
question that goes a totally different question, **please do not hesitate**.

The course will be much better if we can talk about topics that interest you!

# What is Artificial Life?

- Reproducing life-like systems to understand life.
- "Life as it could be"

---

# What is Artificial Life? Conway's "Game of Life"

---

# Types of Artificial Life

Artificial Life research is usually divided in three large areas, depending on
the type of approached used to produce the life-like system.

- "Soft Alife"
- "Hard Alife"
- "Wet Alife"

# Artificial Life Systems

We will study a few examples of Artificial Life Systems, and what we can learn
from them.

---

# Diffusion Systems

---

# Self-Replicating Systems

- Cellular Automata
- Self-replicators
  - Self-replications and evolution (more next class!)
- Artificial Chemistry

---

# Artificial Biology

- Avida: Replication of cells, genes and evolution

---

# Agency Systems

- What is Agency?
- Agency of Simple Robots
- Non-intelligent system with Agency (Oil Drops and Crystal)
- Agency and Human iteraction

---

# Hands-on Experimentation with Alife Systems

In this section, I will introduce the following three systems in more detail.
You are invited to explore these systems by yourself, make your own discoveries,
and exchange your impressions with others in the class.

- Game of Life
- Avida
- The Bibites
