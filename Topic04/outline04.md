Introduction to Neural Networks and Machine Learning

# Outline
- This is a huge topic
- I will do a quick check on the main concepts, and talk about a few projects as examples.
- I will not talk too much about the hype topics of the days. But you can ask me questions!

# Basics of Neural Networks
- Concept of a Neural Network: From neuron to Perceptron
- Layers
  - What are Layers
  - Deep Neural Network
  - Convolution
- How to train a neural network:
  - Backpropagation
  - Training and Testing: Overfitting
- Example: OPERA Project

# Neural Networks and Evolutionary Computation
- Using Evolutionary Computation for optimization
- Using Evolutionary Computation for Network
- Example: Fabio's Robots
  - Compositional Neural Networks

# Basics of Reinforcement learning
- Reinforcement Learning Before Neural Networks
- Reinforcement Learning and Neural Networks
- AI Gym

# Neural Networks and Artificial Life
- Neuroevolution
- The bibite's project

# Hands on Neural Networks
- Create a Bibite

# *TODO* Future topics:
- Ethical Issues
- Transformers
- Generative Models
