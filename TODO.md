# Improvements for this Course.

## Add Programming / Creative assignment

- Students should learn by doing, not by watching.
- Assignments should be creative, and leave space for experimentation and weirdness
- Probably Python/Jupiter, although Javascript might be more accessible.
- Should remain an option to "skip" assignments.

## Project Oriented Course

- Instead of a topic oriented course (don't try to teach everything), a project oriented course.
- For each topic, choose a project that can be used to learn about that topic, and do a hands-on demonstration/hacking of that project.
- "Doing is better than Watching"
- Be aware of software installation requirements. Use online resources as much as possible.

- One unit on game programming / Pico8
- One unit on world generation
