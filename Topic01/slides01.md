# The goal of this course

.cols[
.c80[
**Artificial Intelligence** (AI) is an extremely hot topic today. All researchers
want to do it, all companies want to buy it, all governments want to use it!

However, there are so many different views of AI that sometimes it is hard to
actually understand what it is, where it came from, and **what it could be**.

.c30[
.right[![:scale 60%](img/irasutoya_robot.png)]
]]

In this course I want to give you a _wide_ view of topics related "Artificial Intelligence", today and in the past, beginning with the fundamental ideas of **Bioinspired Computation** and **Artificial Life** (Alife).

I hope you can learn some fun and inspiring ideas in this course!

One of the motivations behind this material is to help onboard new
students to my laboratory. So if you do enjoy these topics, do consider joining
our group in the future üòÄ]

# About yourselves

.largetext[
- What is your name?


- Talk about your non-academic background:
  - What are your hobbies, interests, things that make you happy?


- Talk about your academic background:
  - What is your area? Why is this area interesting?


- What do you expect of this course?

# Format of our classes:

.largetext[
Each day focuses on one large topic:

- Morning Session: Lectures and discussion
  - Understanding the basics;
  - Learning interesting examples;
  - Research project overview;

- Afternoon Session: Hands-on Practice
]

---

# Main topics of the Course:

.largetext[
- **Day 1**: Artificial Life .greentext[<-- Today!]


- **Day 2**: Evolutionary computation


- **Day 3**: Multi Agent Systems


- **Day 4**: Neural Networks and Machine Learning


- **Day 5**: Group work and presentation

# Important: Stop me to ask questions!

.largetext[
The four topics of this course are .redtext[huge]. It is
impossible to cover everything in five days.

So I want to focus on the .greentext[interesting parts].

If you want to know more about something,  
or if you want to ask a question, **please ask it right away!**.

It will be more fun if we have an active conversation!

# Report and Grading

.largetext[
This course will be graded on a report. (Deadline, October 13th)

In this report, you will write a **research proposal** using the topics
presented in this course, **and your own study field**.

Think interdisciplinarity!

On Friday you will make a short presentation about your idea for
the report. I will give feedback on your idea for your report.

More details Friday!]

# Extra Reading
.cols[
.col75[
.largetext[
I listed many suggested reading materials in the course page.

(Including books, papers, blogs and novels!)

Make sure to read them to complement your knowledge!

# Types of Artificial Life

Artificial Life research is usually divided in three large areas, depending on
the type of approached used to produce the life-like system.

- "Soft Alife"
- "Hard Alife"
- "Wet Alife"

# Hands-on Experimentation with Alife Systems

In this section, I will introduce the following three systems in more detail.
You are invited to explore these systems by yourself, make your own discoveries,
and exchange your impressions with others in the class.

- Game of Life
- Avida
- The Bibites
