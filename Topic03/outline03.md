The third lecture talks about Multi-Agent systems, focusing on research projects
that our group is currently working on.

# Introduction to Multi Agent Systems
## What are Multi Agent Systems
## Bioinspired MAS Examples:
- Boids
- Predator/Prey Simulation

# Applications of Multi Agent Systems
## Social Simulation
- Evacuation Simulation (one room, one city)
- Epidemics Simulation (probably long)
- City Generation (Luiz Work)
- Virtual Archaeology (HOMINIDs)

## Games
- Social Games: AIWolf, Hanabi
- Multi-Agent Level Generation: Minecraft, GDMC

## Multi Agent Systems in Artificial Life
- Soft Robots Ecology;
- Alife with Heterogeneous Agents;
- Environment Simulations;

# Issues in Multi Agent Systems
- How to represent the knowledge of an agent?
- How to represent the knowledge of OTHER agents (AIWolf)
- How to use data from Human societies in MAS

# Hands-on Learning
- Boids, Something else?
