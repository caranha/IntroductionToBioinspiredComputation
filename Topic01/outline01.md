## Artificial life

### Basic Ideas

So today we are going to talk about "Artificial Life". But what does this
actually mean?

*Wonderful but vague*
When I think about artificial life, I actually get very excited about it,
for me it is a topic that inspire wonder, infinite possibilities, unbounded
creativity. But when I think about it, I also realize that it is a bit hard
to explain precisely what is so wonderful about this topic. So let me try
to break down the ideas of artificial life to you.

*First Impressions*
Let's start by our first impression. What do you imagine when I say
the words "Artificial Life"? Do you remember the "tamagochi"? Those
were small devices that contained a virtual creature. You had to press a
button every day to give the creature food, play with it, give it medicine
if it was sick, and clean it. If you didn't take care of your tamagochi, it
would die. But if you took good care of it, it would leave an egg for you,
with another tamagochi inside.

Was the Tamagochi alive? It needed to eat and sleep, and it could die
or reproduce. Many people had an emotional attachment to their tamagochi.
If the Tamagochi was a living being, should we consider it to be
animal abuse to not give it food?

I would say that Tamagochi was probably not alive. But when we make this
question, `what it takes for something to be considered alive`, we start to
see the importance of Artificial Life as a field of study.

*Life from First Principles*
The tamagochi is lovely and very cute, but when we start to think about the
"characteristics of life", we need to be careful about what kind of life
we are thinking about.

The vast majority of living beings on earth are actually microorganisms with a
single cell. They are not cute, and they do not play with us, but they are
certainly alife.

Again, thinking about these unicellular organisms gives us the chance to
discuss: "What are the properties of life?". More importantly, these simple
living organisms give us the opportunity to observe the difference between
living and non-living systems, which might help us to figure out how to
cross the threshold from non-life into life.

*But Why?*
There is so much life on earth, why do we want to create Artificial Life?

One way to think about this is "build something to understand something".
As we try to build a system that we can consider alive, we are forced to
what life means, and what are its requisites.

This reflection has practical uses too! For example, as we consider the
limits of what life could look like, this reflection has implications about
how we look for life outside our own planet.

To finish on a more personal note, the idea of trying to create artificial
systems that could show all the creativity and exuberance that we see in life
has a very strong appeal to me -- like creating eternal art that takes care of
itself after you're gone.

*Discussion:*
At this point, I would like to invite you to imagine and discuss what does
it mean to study and create artificial life. Here are some discussion points:

- What are the characteristics of a living system?
  - Think wide: not only humans and dogs and bears, but also plants, fungus,
    bacteria and viruses.
- What are the open questions about life in general?
- What could be the applications for an artificial life form?

### Example: The Game of Life

Let's see a classical example of "Artificial Life". Conway's Game of Life




In the end, talk about Conway: Conway didn't even want this to be his biggest
work.
